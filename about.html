			<h1>What is SEPEP?</h1>
			<p>SEPEP stands for <strong>Sports Education in Physical Education Program.</strong></p>
			<p>SEPEP is constructed around a student centred approach to physical education. This is where the teachers step down from the 'leaders' of the class and allow their students to take control and collaborate on the roles and responsibilities involved.</p>
			<p>The SEPEP program provides an experience of what the real world will be like, in their jobs and everyday lives.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="about-sections" id="roles">

		<div class="about-sections" id="spikeball">
			<h1>Spikeball</h1>
			<p>The sport we are given to play during this SEPEP unit is Spikeball.<br>
			Spikeball is a net sport inspired primarily by concepts from volleyball. There is a circular net in the middle of the players on which the ball bounces as it is passed to the different teams. The aim of the game is to successfully bounce the ball on the net to the other team and for them to not be able to hit it back.</p>

		<div class="about-sections" id="rules">
			<br>
			<h1>Rules</h1>
			<p style="font-size:18px;">These are the official (and slightly modified) rules that our <strong>Governing Body</strong> has come up with. These are the rules that are followed during each competitive game of Spikeball.</p> <br>
			<ol>
				<li>Spikeball is a no contact sport. If deliberate contact is made (decided by umpire), then replay the point.</li>
				<li>The games are 8 minutes each, split into two halves for subbing. You MUST sub at least one player when the first half is over.</li>
				<li>If timeout is needed (eg. Due to injury or subbing in other players), make a “T” to indicate this. Timeouts last 30 seconds maximum, unless otherwise specified.</li>
				<li>Games are won by which team has the most points at the end of the 8 minutes.</li>
				<li>No guarding or touching the net with any part of the body. This rule also includes obstruction of gameplay & players. If this occurs, replay the point.</li>
				<li>Everyone must have a turn at serving – you must not have the same server more than three times in a row.</li>
				<li>The team which won the last point serves.</li>
				<li>When serving, there are 2 faults (like in tennis) before possession changes and a point is given to the other team.</li>
				<li>Points are scored if:
					<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha; padding-bottom:0;">
						<li style="margin-left:2em">The other team fails to return the ball to the net</li>
						<li style="margin-left:2em; padding-bottom: 0;">The team cannot return the ball to the net on the third pass</li>
						<li style="margin-left:2em; padding-bottom: 0;">Any contact from a player is made with the net</li>
						<li style="margin-left:2em; padding-bottom: 0;">The ball hits the rim when bounced on the net</li>
						<li style="margin-left:2em; padding-bottom: 0;">The other team touched the ball without it hitting the net</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>All body parts can be used to hit the ball, however you must serve by throwing it at the net with your hands, otherwise it will be counted as a fool.</li>
				<li>Ball must bounce out of the net to still be in play.</li>
				<li>There is a ‘halfway line’ during a serve only, which horizontally divides the playing space while a team serves; once the ball bounces off the net, the play is 360 degrees.</li>
				<li>Ball cannot go higher/further than 2 meters from the net.</li>
			</ol>
